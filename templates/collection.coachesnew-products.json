A few days later we go her blood tested and her platelet production was through the roof! It has since stayed that way and her tests have continued to be normal! We are so grateful for her and definitely recommend her.” <br\/><\/p>",

It was also very inspiring to hear how the program allowed her to help dogs improve their health and get better through food and movement. It was also reassuring to learn the is the ongoing support from Dr. Roberts and the rest of the team. Well, after the course is over, I am super excited to dive in and learn all I can to help dogs thrive and live their best life. Thanks.<\/p>",

She was able see what their challenges were and restore balance to all of my animals as well as myself. Everything she said made perfect sense. During the session all of them were calmer than usual and the results are incredible! They are all much more relaxed as well as wanting to walk longer, 2 of them are over 10 years old and back to acting like younger animals while outside running and playing with each other. As for my experience after the session, I've been feeling much calmer yet energetic and centered. Thank you, Laura, for all you do and your perfect love for all animals. Much appreciated. I will be connecting again. I highly recommend Laura! We will book Laura again! <\/p>",

The report she provided was extremely detailed, showing that Bea had put in a lot of effort into her work since my dog has a lot of health issues. I highly appreciate her help.<\/em><\/p>",

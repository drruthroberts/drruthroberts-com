During the session all of them were calmer than usual and the results are incredible! They are all much more relaxed as well as wanting to walk longer, 2 of them are over 10 years old and back to acting like younger animals while outside running and playing with each other. As for my experience after the session, I've been feeling much calmer yet energetic and centered. Thank you, Laura, for all you do and your perfect love for all animals. Much appreciated. I will be connecting again. I highly recommend Laura! We will book Laura again! <\/p>",

She walked me through the homework, answered my questions, shared her screen to show me how to get to the information that I had not been able to find. The pet consultation was informative and she had good suggestions on additional things to do for my dog. It was interesting to learn that he is a metal type dog, I looked up information on a metal dog and it fits his personality well.<\/p>",
